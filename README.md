# AvatarDownloader

Very simple quick dirty downloader for virtual you avatars from the hifi marketplace.

Build using visual studio, would probably also be fine using VSCode. Requires .net core.

Command line argument is the id from the end of the hifi marketplace URL eg. https://metaverse.highfidelity.com/marketplace/items/<this bit>
